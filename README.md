# AirControlX - Automated Air Traffic Control System ðŸ›«

AirControlX is a multithreaded, simulation-based Air Traffic Control System built in C/C++. It models real-world ATC operations such as runway allocation, flight scheduling, emergency handling, and real-time monitoring, using Operating System concepts like threading, synchronization, process management, scheduling, and IPC.

###  Project Overview
AirControlX simulates an intelligent and automated airspace management system. The core system comprises multiple flight threads requesting landings or takeoffs, a central ATC controller assigning runways, and subsystems managing events like emergencies and violations.

### Core Concepts Used
- Multithreading (`pthread`)
- Mutexes and semaphores
- Priority scheduling
- Process management and IPC
- Event-driven simulation
- CLI-based interaction

### Key Features
1)	Flight Creation & Entry: Batch mode & real-time input
2)	Runway Management: Separate queues for arrivals and departures with priority handling
3)	Violations & Faults: Speed checks, brake failures, emergency landings
4)	Dynamic Scheduling: SJF/SRTF/RR-based flight handling
5)	Subsystems Integration:
    a)	ATC Controller
    b)	Airline Portal
    c)	AVN Coordination
    d)	Simulated Payment System
6)	Real-Time Monitoring: Live status updates and queue logs

### How to Run

#### Prerequisites
- GCC Compiler
- Linux (or WSL)
- Make

####  Build
bash
make all

#### Run simulation
./aircontrolx
