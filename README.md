# AirControlX - Automated Air Traffic Control System ðŸ›«

AirControlX is a multithreaded, simulation-based Air Traffic Control System built in C/C++. It models real-world ATC operations such as runway allocation, flight scheduling, emergency handling, and real-time monitoring, using Operating System concepts like threading, synchronization, process management, scheduling, and IPC.

##  Project Overview
AirControlX simulates an intelligent and automated airspace management system. The core system comprises multiple flight threads requesting landings or takeoffs, a central ATC controller assigning runways, and subsystems managing events like emergencies and violations.
